First look in current scope
  Implicits defined in current scope
  Explicit imports
  Wildcard imports  

Now look at associated types in
  Companion objects of a type
  Implicit scope of an argumentâ€™s type (2.9.1)
  Implicit scope of type arguments (2.8.0)
  Outer objects for nested types
  Other dimensions



!!! Conflict only happens if more than one candidate per stage
  => "low priority" implicits === default implicits



!!! Implicit resolution happens at compile time.



--- Implicits commonly live in "package object"

package geotrellis
package object vector {

  implicit def tupleOfIntToPoint(t: (Double, Double)): Point =
    Point(t._1,t._2)

  implicit def tupleOfDoubleToPoint(t: (Int, Int)): Point =
    Point(t._1,t._2)

  ...
}

--- import geotrellis.vector._
  brings in the implicits
